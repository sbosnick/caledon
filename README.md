# Caledon

**Caledon is a Rust implementation of the Wayland protocol.**

Caledon implements the [Wayland] display server protocol directly in Rust without any
dependancies on C code. It provides an implementation of the [Wayland] wire protocol
and abstractions to expose the various [Wayland] protocol messages as types.

Caledon will (eventually) also proivde abstractions for building [Wayland] clients
and servers.
